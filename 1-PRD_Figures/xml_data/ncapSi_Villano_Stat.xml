The data format is a list of pairs for each point corresponding to the x and y uncertainty. e.g.
{
{recoil energy sigma_1, yield sigma_1},
{recoil energy sigma_2, yield sigma_2},
{recoil energy sigma_final, yield sigma_final}
}
In case of assymteric uncertainties, please enter a pair for the x- and y- value respectively e.g.
You can mix-match symmetric and assymetric uncertainties for x- and y-
{
{{recoil sigma low_1, recoil sigma high_1}, yield sigma_1},
{{recoil sigma low_2, recoil sigma high_2}, {yield sigma low_2, yield sigma high_2}},
{recoil sigma low_final, {yield sigma low_final, yield sigma high_final}},
}

In all cases, please use the scientific notation 1.234e-40 for the values.
